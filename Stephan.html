				<p>
						Stephan has been in the Mortgage Lending Industry for almost two decades. 
						Born and raised in Switzerland, he graduated Summa Cum Laude from the University of California at Berkeley.	
						<br />
						Stephan understands that every loan transaction is as unique as is the financial and credit profile of each
						individual client. Matching a client’s specific situation and goals with the right loan program is his mission and
						excellence in execution is his daily goal.
						<br />
						What Stephan enjoys most is to provide his clients with sound advice and educate them about their mortgage
						loan options. Stephan loves working as much with first time home buyers as he is working with seasoned real
						estate investors. Stephan strives to always stay informed about changes in the mortgage industry, to stay
						ahead of the curve, and to always expand the programs available to his clients. That is why he is one of the
						few mortgage brokers who specialize in both residential and commercial real estate lending. He understands
						the intricacies of providing financing for an office or retail property as much as he is seasoned in executing a
						VA, FHA, or Reverse mortgage transaction.
						<br />
						That is why 99% of his business comes from referrals and repeat clients.
