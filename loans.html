					<h3>FHA Loans</h3>
						<p>FHA Loans benefit buyers with little down payment. FHA requires only 3.5% down payment, whereas typically conventional loans require 5%
							and 10% down payment. FHA loans also allow for increased Debt-to-Income Ratios and lower FICO scores. Whereas the interest rates are
							typically lower than for conventional loans, FHA loans has higher fees, both upfront and monthly, which as a whole makes them more
							expensive than regular conforming loans.
							<br />
							<br />
							Since April 2013, FHA’s monthly Mortgage Insurance (MI) is permanent, whereas previous to that date the MI was required only for a
							minimum of 5 years. Now, as long as the borrower has the FHA loan, no matter how much equity there is in the property, the borrower has
							to keep the MI. Before, once the property had at least 22% equity, the borrowers could request the MI to be removed after 5 years.
							<br />
							<br />
							In addition to a monthly mortgage insurance, FHA also requires Upfront Mortgage Insurance. That is a one-time fee that is added to the
							closing cost (but can be financed).
							<br />
							<br />
							However, the combination of low down payment, low FICO score requirement, and high Debt-to-Income limit, make FHA loans a very
							important alternative to home owners and buyers. FHA loans offer solutions to buyers and owners that otherwise would not exist, thus
							making FHA loans indispensable in the mortgage market place.
							<br />
						</p>
					<h3>Veterans Affairs Loans</h3>
						<p>The VA does not make loans, but it backs loans made by private lenders and banks that offer loans for qualified veterans. In order to obtain a
							VA loan, a veteran should complete the VA’s form 26-1880 to request a Certificate of Eligibility (COE) from the VA. Potentially qualified
							individuals are: Veterans, Active duty personnel, Reservists/National guard members, and military spouses. The following services qualify:
							Public Health Service officers, cadets at the United States Military, Air Force, or Coast Guard Academy, midshipmen at the United States Naval
							Academy, officers of National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration, merchant seaman with World War II service.
							Obtaining a COE does not automatically guarantee approval of the loan request but it allows for a veteran to apply for a home loan. The
							veteran must have been discharged under conditions other than dishonorable.
							<br />
							<br />
							VA loans are offered for the purchase of a primary residence only (i.e. not for investment properties). The main benefits of a VA
							loan are:
							-	No down payment required (100% financing)
							-	Increased affordability: because VA loans allow for significantly higher Debt-To-Income ratios than most other loans, a VA loan
								applicant can therefore qualify for a higher loan amount than other loan programs would normally allow
							-	VA refinances allow for cash out to 100% LTV
							<br />
							Limits and Costs:
							-	In most cases, the VA charges a funding fee of 3.3% (as of this writing). That fee can be financed (‘rolled into the loan’) and thus a VA
								potentially can reach 103.3% LTV.
							There is no Mortgage Insurance required no matter what the Loan-to-Value ratio is.
							<br />

					<h3>Conforming Loans and Qualified Mortgage Loans</h3>
						<p>
							Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are the nicknames bestowed upon two government-sponsored entities -- the Federal National Mortgage
Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation. These corporations have an active role in providing financial security to
mortgage lenders and banks by purchasing certain mortgage loans from them. There are limits on the loan sizes the Fannie and Freddie
accepts. These limits vary from county to county and are related to each county’s median home price.Fannie and Freddie only purchase
loans that they deem as "conforming." There are various qualifications that a mortgage loan has to meet to conform to the rules, but one
of the most important is the actual loan amount.
							<br />
							<br />
							A conforming loan must follow the qualified mortgage rules that came into effect on January 2014.
							<br />
							<br />
							The qualified mortgage rule, as defined by Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), is designed to create safer loans by prohibiting or
limiting certain high-risk products and features. Lenders that offer QM loans will receive legal protection against borrower lawsuits.
							<br />
							<br />
							
						<h5>What Defines a Qualified Mortgage</h5>
							<br />
							<br />
							The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau issued the definition of a Qualified Mortgage (QM) and basically contain the following key features:
							<br />
							<br />
						<h5>No Excessive Upfront Points and Fees</h5>
							<br />
							<br />
							In this context, ‘points and fees’ are additional costs charged by the lender during mortgage application, processing and closing. The QM rule puts a limit on these additional charges.
							<br />
							<br />
							Generally speaking, the points and fees paid by the borrower must not exceed 3% of the total amount borrowed, if the loan is to be considered a qualified mortgage. Certain exceptions have been made for ‘bona fide discount points’ on prime loans.
							<br />
							<br />
						<h5>No Toxic Loan Features</h5>
							<br />
							<br />
							In this context, a ‘toxic’ loan feature can refer to any high-risk feature that may have contributed to the mortgage and housing collapse of 2008. Such features are prohibited by the qualified mortgage rule, as defined by CFPB:
							<br />
							<br />
							• No interest-only loans. These are mortgage products where the borrower defers the repayment of principal and pays only the interest, usually for a certain period of time.
							• No negative-amortization loans. These are loans where the principal amount borrowed increases over time, even while monthly payments are being made. This often happens as the result of the interest-only payments mentioned above.	
							• No terms beyond 30 years. In order to meet the definition of a qualified mortgage, the loan must have a repayment term of 30 years or less.
							• No balloon loans. In most cases, balloon loans will be prohibited by the QM rules. But some exceptions have been made. Smaller lenders in ‘rural or underserved areas’ may still make such loans. Definition: A balloon mortgage is one that has a larger-than-normal payment at the end of the repayment term.
							<br />
							<br />	
						<h5>Limits on Debt-to-Income Ratios</h5>
							In general, the qualified mortgage will be granted to borrowers with debt-to-income / DTI ratios no higher than 43%.
As the name implies, the debt-to-income ratio compares the amount of money a person earns each month (gross
monthly income) to the amount he or she spends on recurring debt obligations.
							<br />
							<br />	
							This aspect of the QM rule is intended to prevent consumers from taking on mortgage loans they cannot realistically afford.

							Lenders that generate QM-compliant mortgage loans will receive some degree of legal protection against borrower
lawsuits. The level of protection they receive will depend on the type of loan they make.
QM loans can be both Fixed and Adjustable Rate Mortgage (ARM) loans:
							<br />
							<br />	
							30 Year Fixed, Amortized over 30 Years
20 Year Fixed, Amortized over 20 Years
15 Year Fixed, Amortized over 15 Years
10 Year Fixed, Amortized over 10 Years
3 Year ARM, Amortized over 30 Years
5 Year ARM, Amortized over 30 Years
7 Year ARM, Amortized over 30 Years
10 Year ARM, Amortized over 30 Years
