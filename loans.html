						<h3>FHA Loans</h3>
						<p>FHA Loans benefit buyers with little down payment. FHA requires only 3.5% down payment, whereas typically conventional loans require 5%
							and 10% down payment. FHA loans also allow for increased Debt-to-Income Ratios and lower FICO scores. Whereas the interest rates are
							typically lower than for conventional loans, FHA loans has higher fees, both upfront and monthly, which as a whole makes them more
							expensive than regular conforming loans.
							<br />
							<br />
							Since April 2013, FHA’s monthly Mortgage Insurance (MI) is permanent, whereas previous to that date the MI was required only for a
							minimum of 5 years. Now, as long as the borrower has the FHA loan, no matter how much equity there is in the property, the borrower has
							to keep the MI. Before, once the property had at least 22% equity, the borrowers could request the MI to be removed after 5 years.
							<br />
							<br />
							In addition to a monthly mortgage insurance, FHA also requires Upfront Mortgage Insurance. That is a one-time fee that is added to the
							closing cost (but can be financed).
							<br />
							<br />
							However, the combination of low down payment, low FICO score requirement, and high Debt-to-Income limit, make FHA loans a very
							important alternative to home owners and buyers. FHA loans offer solutions to buyers and owners that otherwise would not exist, thus
							making FHA loans indispensable in the mortgage market place.
							<br />
						</p>
						<h3>Veterans Affairs Loans</h3>
						<p>The VA does not make loans, but it backs loans made by private lenders and banks that offer loans for qualified veterans. In order to obtain a
							VA loan, a veteran should complete the VA’s form 26-1880 to request a Certificate of Eligibility (COE) from the VA. Potentially qualified
							individuals are: Veterans, Active duty personnel, Reservists/National guard members, and military spouses. The following services qualify:
							Public Health Service officers, cadets at the United States Military, Air Force, or Coast Guard Academy, midshipmen at the United States Naval
							Academy, officers of National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration, merchant seaman with World War II service.
							Obtaining a COE does not automatically guarantee approval of the loan request but it allows for a veteran to apply for a home loan. The
							veteran must have been discharged under conditions other than dishonorable.
							<br />
							<br />
							VA loans are offered for the purchase of a primary residence only (i.e. not for investment properties). The main benefits of a VA
							loan are:
							-	No down payment required (100% financing)
							-	Increased affordability: because VA loans allow for significantly higher Debt-To-Income ratios than most other loans, a VA loan
								applicant can therefore qualify for a higher loan amount than other loan programs would normally allow
							-	VA refinances allow for cash out to 100% LTV
							<br />
							Limits and Costs:
							-	In most cases, the VA charges a funding fee of 3.3% (as of this writing). That fee can be financed (‘rolled into the loan’) and thus a VA
								potentially can reach 103.3% LTV.
							There is no Mortgage Insurance required no matter what the Loan-to-Value ratio is.
